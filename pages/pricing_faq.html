  <span class="highlight"><b>Bang! Howdy Payment Questions</b></span>
</p>

<p>You can play Bang! Howdy for free. There is no limit on your ability to play
games and enjoy most features of the game for as long as you like.</p>

<p>However, there are certain items in the game that may require payment if you
wish to buy them. You buy these items by first buying Gold Coins using our <a
href="https://billing.banghowdy.com/billing/">payment system</a> and then using
those Gold Coins in the game to buy items.</p>

<h2>How to Pay</h2>

<p><span class="highlight">How do I pay with a Credit Card?</span><br>
You can do so from
<a href="https://billing.banghowdy.com/billing/buy_coins.wm">this page</a> of
the payment system.</p>

<p>We accept VISA, MasterCard and American Express cards. Debit / ATM cards
with the VISA / MasterCard logo should work fine. This is the preferred payment
mechanism as it gives you instant access and keeps things simple for us and
inexpensive for you.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Is your Credit Card server secure?</span><br>

Absolutely. Our credit card server is secured with 128bit industry-standard SSL
encryption. You can verify this by looking for the golden padlock in the bottom
corner of your web browser window.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">What appears on my credit card statement?</span><br>

Your credit card statement will show a billing for 'Three Rings'. That's us,
the company that makes Bang! Howdy.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Can I pay via PayPal?</span><br>

Yes, there is an option to pay using PayPal on
<a href="https://billing.banghowdy.com/billing/paypal.wm?choice=coins">this
page</a> of the payment system, and your account will be instantly credited
following payment.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Can I pay via Check or Money Order?</span><br>

By all means, send us a check or money order denominated in US Dollars (you may
need to get an International Money Order in US Currency).</p>

<p>Payable to: Three Rings Design, Inc.</p>

<p>Please ensure that you include the username you use to login (not your
cowboy name). Please send us the correct amount so we're not in doubt of what
you're buying (see prices below).</p>

<p>We will send you a confirmation email when your payment is received, so make
sure you have your current email address configured for your account on
<a href="http://www.banghowdy.com/register/">this page</a>!</p>

<p>Pricing for Gold Coins are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>$2.95 for 12 Gold Coins (~$0.25c per Coin)</li>
<li>$9.95 for 42 Gold Coins (~$0.24c per Coin)</li>
<li>$19.95 for 90 Gold Coins (~$0.22c per Coin)</li>
<li>$99.95 for 500 Gold Coins (~$0.20c per Coin)</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="highlight">Can I pay via Text Messages (SMS)?</span><br>

We are currently offering players in the following countries to buy Gold Coins
and subscriptions via text messages: UK, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and
Finland. Not all phone providers are supported. Go to
<a href="https://billing.banghowdy.com/billing/sms_coins.wm">this page</a> of
the payment system to find out if yours is.</p>

<p>If your phone provider is available then follow the instructions on that
page to send a text message and wait until you get a text message back with a 6
digit code you can enter on that same page to receive your Gold Coins.</p>

<p>Be aware that some phone service providers charge you for sending a text
message, so take this amount into account to ensure that there are still funds
available for the Gold Coin cost. Otherwise it may fail but you will still be
charged for sending the text message.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Can I pay at the Grocery Store?</span><br>

Simply go to a <a href="http://www.coinstar.com/">Coinstar</a> machine. There
are nearly 65,000 worldwide. Search
<a href="http://www.coinstar.com/cgi-bin/mqlocator.exe?link=find">here</a> to
find the one nearest you.</p>

<p>Place coins/bills in the machine and get a Green Dot &trade; Prepaid
MasterCard&reg; that you can then use with Bang! Howdy.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Can I use my bank's Electronic Bill Pay?</span><br>

Certainly. Simply go to the Bill Pay section of your online bank account.</p>

<p>Please ensure that you include the username you use to login (not your

in doubt of what you're buying. You may refer above for pricing
information.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Can I pay via another method (Cash, Debit Cards,
Splash Plastic, etc.)?</span><br>

Yes, we now offer payment via PayByCash, which accepts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Certa-Pay</li>
<li>Check via Postal Service or FAX</li>
<li>Cyphermint's PayCash System</li>
<li>Direct Debit</li>
<li>e-gold&reg;</li>
<li>Easecard</li>
<li>eNets</li>
<li>GoldMoney&reg;</li>

<li>Western Union QuickPay&trademark;</li>
<li>Western Union SwiftPay&trademark;</li>
<li>Wire or Bank Transfer</li>
<li>WebMoney Transfer</li>
</ul>

<p>However, they charge an additional fee for their service which is passed on
to you with a higher cost.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">I live outside the US, how should I pay?</span><br>

Your non-US credit card should work fine if it is a VISA, MasterCard or
American Express. Alternatively, use one of the other payment options listed
above.</o>

<p>You will be responsible for converting your currency into US Dollars. With a
credit card, PayPal, PayByCash or Text Message transaction this will happen
automatically. To get a US Dollar check or money order you will probably have
to visit the bank, or perhaps your post office.</p>

<h2>Problems with Payments</h2>

<p><span class="highlight">My credit card keeps being declined, but I know I
have funds?</span><br>

You are probably entering the incorrect security code. Follow the instructions
on the page carefully. If it continues to fail then you should probably
consider PayPal or another payment method listed above.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">My credit card was Declined, but it still got
charged?!</span><br>

Actually, your credit card has not been charged if it was declined. However,
some banks (your bank, it has nothing to do with our bank or credit card
processing procedures) place a hold on funds when an authorization is requested
even though they have declined the charge. This apparently happens more often
with ATM / Debit Cards. The funds are then released again after a few days,
when the bank realizes that actually no charge was placed (which is
unsurprising, as they denied it).</p>

<p>We are completely perplexed by this behavior, but according to our bank it
is commonplace and there is absolutely nothing we can do to prevent it. Our
apologies. If this happens to you we suggest you use another payment mechanism
(PayPal, check, above).</p>

<p><span class="highlight">I sent a text message but did not receive a code
back?</span><br>

If after a couple of hours you did not receive the text message with a code to
enter, you will not have been charged by your phone provider for that order. We
recommend that you verify that you have not been charged with your phone
company, and ask them if they are aware of any reason why you did not receive
the reply SMS message. An exception to this rule is Finnish Sonera which will
charge upon sending. Also make sure you have room for new Text Messages and
sufficient funds to pay for the order.</p>

<h2><a name="hitlimit">Other Questions</a></h2>

<p><span class="highlight">The payment system is telling me that I can't buy
any more Gold Coins! What do I do?</span><br>

Due to issues with fraud and credit card abuse, we have a limit imposed on the
total amount a player can spend without sending a signed authorization to Three
Rings. To extend your limit you will need to send us:</p>

<ul>
<li>A photocopy of an official ID. The ID holder and signatory must be over 18
years old. If you are concerned about the security of your ID please make a
note of this on the page, and we will shred this page immediately upon receipt
and confirmation of your identity.</li>
<li>A signed authorization form acknowledging that you are responsible for
these transactions. This page will be retained for our records.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may send us this information via Fax to US (1) 415 615 6895.</p>
