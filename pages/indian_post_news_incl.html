<tr><td valign="top">
A new scrip bonus has been added to <b>Forest Guardians</b>! For each
successfully completed wave (where you saved at least half the trees), you will
receive a scrip bonus equal to the amount of saws for that wave.  For example,
you finished three waves that were 4, 5 and 6 saws respectively, then everyone
will get 15 extra scrip on top of their normal earnings.
