<table><tr><td><span class="subhead">NOV 13 RELEASE NOTES</span>
<p> Most of the changes in this patch were not town specific, so check out the
notes on the <b>Announcement forums</b> or in <b>Frontier Town</b> for
details. There were a couple of ITP specific bits:<br><br>
&#8211; Made the <b>Peace Pipe</b> work on Logging Robots' proximity attack<br>
&#8211; Modified the <b>Forest Guardians AI</b> to hopefully make it less
annoying<br><br>
That's all for now pardners.
