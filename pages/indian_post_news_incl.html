<p> Thanks for coming to check out Bang! Howdy. We're still workin' on this
here part of the game but we wanted you to get an idea of how much more
exciting and diverse the game is getting as we add new towns.<br><br>

In each town, we add new units, new cards and bonuses, new avatar duds and new
gameplay scenarios. It's like a whole new take on the game. Once we finish up
the <b>Indian Trading Post</b>, we'll be moving on to <b>Boom Town</b> and
really focusing on the robot aspects of our Steampunk Wild West.
