Leaving a game against other players will not make you a popular cowpoke.
Hightailing it out of a ranked game early will cause your ranks to drop and
will reduce the amount of scrip you earn in future games.  Best just to stick
around 'til the end of the game, you'll still earn scrip, and maybe even learn
a thing or two.
