<h2>Getting Help</h2>

<p>
  It's the Wild West out here pardner! Bang! Howdy used to be operated by a small game company
  without a whole lotta money. Now it's operated by the two ex-founders of that game company with
  even less money. In fact, everything is paid for out of their own pockets and out of the goodness
  of their hearts.
</p>

<p>
  That means there ain't much in the way of formal support, technical or otherwise. We don't have
  the resources to operate forums any longer, and we definitely don't have the resources to pay
  people to help you be nice to each other. So you'll just have to do it yerselves!
</p>

<p>
  If you have technical or gameplay questions, you can try asking over on the
  <a href="http://http://gaming.stackexchange.com/">Gaming Stack Exchange</a> site.
  Be sure to tag your question with <code>#bang-howdy</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Good luck out there, and thanks fer playin'!
