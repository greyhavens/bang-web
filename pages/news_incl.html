&#x2666; Back Parlors are here. Click "Create" over yonder to check them out.<br>
&#x2666; Totally rewrote the animation system. Loading should be a lot faster
and the game is about 10 megs smaller.<br>
&#x2666; Added "Top Ranked" lists click the "more" button down below or
"Top Scorers" above to have a look (we'll change the name to be consistent in
the next release).<br>
&#x2666; Added user interface sound effects. Buttons click and windows zing!<br>

In preparation for Open Beta which starts on May 24th, we're opening up access
a bit and allowing the existing testers to invite anyone they'd like to join in
the fun. Don't publicize this anywhere, but if you have a few friends you want
to get in on the fun, just send them to:<br><br>
http://www.banghowdy.com/alpha.html<br><br>
and have 'em create an account and download the game. They'll be able to get in
and play. Thanks again fer yer help and keep sending them bug reports with
<b>F2</b> when things are misbehavin'.
