<p> "Git off my property!" is the sort of thing yer likely to hear comin' out
of the mouth of this ornery feller. <b>The Shotgunner</b> don't move so fast
but he packs a powerful punch.<br><br>

<p> The Shotgunner shoots a blast so wide that units to the left and right of
his main target take a bit of damage as well. This comes in mighty handy when
yer opponent has brought all hands and the cook down to give you a whuppin'.
