<p> "Git off my property!" is the sort of thing yer likely to hear comin' out
of the mouth of this ornery feller. <b>The Shotgunner</b> don't move so fast
but he packs a powerful punch.<br><br>

<p> The Shotgunner shoots a blast so wide that units to the left and right of
his main target take a bit of damage as well. This comes in mighty handy when
yer opponent has brought all hands and the cook down to give you a whuppin'.

We've been fixing bugs willy nilly, so hopefully things should be running more
smoothly (and running at all for some people). No exciting new features to
report quite yet, but we'll get around to that eventually.<br><br>

Keep up the good work and keep sending them bug reports with <b>F2</b> when
things are misbehavin'.
