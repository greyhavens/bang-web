  <span class="highlight"><b>Alpha Tester Information</b></span>
</p>

<p> Welcome to the Bang! Howdy Alpha Test! This here page is chock full of
information on how to get started and have yerself some Wild West fun.

<p><span class="highlight">Read this First</span><br/>
This is an <span class="highlight">Alpha Test</span> which means a few things:

<ul>

<li> Please don't share any of the information we provide to you on any public
forums. <span class="highlight">No postin' screenshots, no postin' these
URLs.</span> If you want to invite a few friends to come and play, that's great
but otherwise keep it under yer hat. We'd like to slowly invite more people to
the test to avoid being overwhelmed.

<li> The game ain't done yet. Some of the boards aren't very purdy and exist so
that we can test out gameplay ideas. Everything is subject to change.  We'll
try to never have to delete anything or mess up yer accounts, but this here's
the Wild West and if push comes to shove, we have to do everything we can to
make the game great.

<li> We really appreciate your help in testin' out the game and we'll
definitely have something special for ya when all is said and done and we're
ready to go live. So thanks in advance fer being a great tester.
</ul>

<p><span class="highlight">Let Us Know if Ya Have Problems</span><br />

If you have a problem in the game, you can press <span
class="highlight">F2</span> to bring up the bug report dialog and submit a bug.
This is useful because it will send us a debug log from your client.<br/><br/>

If you are having trouble gettin' the game installed or running at all, post to
the <a href="http://forums.banghowdy.com/townhall/mvnforum/listthreads?forum=2">technical
issues forum</a> and tell us what kind of computer you got, what operating
system and any other details you think might help us to figger out what's goin'
awry.<br/><br/>

If ya can't even get into the forums, then <a
href="mailto:mdb@threerings.net">send me an email</a> and we'll try to get that
sorted out. Everyone in the Alpha Test should already have an <a
href="/register/">account</a> with Three Rings for Puzzle Pirates or Game
Gardens, and that account should work for Bang! Howdy too (the forums and the
game). If it ain't workin' or you don't have one, send me email at
<a href="mailto:mdb@threerings.net">mdb@threerings.net</a> and we'll sort you
out.

</p>

<p> Alrighty folks, that's all we got to say fer now. Head on into
<span class="highlight">The Saloon</span> and challenge us to a game!</p>
