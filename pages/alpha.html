  <span class="highlight"><b>Alpha Tester Information</b></span>
</p>

<p> Welcome to the Bang! Howdy Alpha Test! This here page is chock full of
information on how to get started and have yerself some Wild West fun.

<p><span class="highlight">Read this First</span><br/>
This is an <span class="highlight">Alpha Test</span> which means a few things:

<ul>

<li> Please don't share any of the information we provide to you with anyone
else. <span class="highlight">No postin' screenshots, no givin' out these
URLs.</span> We'd like to slowly invite more people to the test to avoid being
overwhelmed, and no one can play the game unless we activate their account
anyway. We'd prefer not to have people showing up in the forums pleading for
access because someone gave out the URL. It will just distract us from
finishing the game.

<li> The game ain't done yet. Some of the boards aren't very purdy and exist so
that we can test out gameplay ideas. Everything is subject to change.  We'll
try to never have to delete anything or mess up yer accounts, but this here's
the Wild West and if push comes to shove, we have to do everything we can to
make the game great.

<li> We really appreciate your help in testin' out the game and we'll
definitely have something special for ya when all is said and done and we're
ready to go live. So thanks in advance fer being a great tester.
</ul>
</p>

</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Read the Alpha Tester Forums</span><br />
We've got a place to talk to us developers and amongst yerselves all set up
right here at the
<a href="http://forums.banghowdy.com/townhall/">Bang! Alpha Forums</a>.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Let Us Know if Ya Have Problems</span><br />

If you have a problem in the game, you can press <span
class="highlight">F2</span> to bring up the bug report dialog and submit a bug.
This is useful because it will send us a debug log from your client.<br/><br/>

If you are having trouble gettin' the game installed or running at all, post to
the <a href="http://forums.banghowdy.com/townhall/mvnforum/listthreads?forum=2">technical
issues forum</a> and tell us what kind of computer you got, what operating
system and any other details you think might help us to figger out what's goin'
awry.<br/><br/>

If ya can't even get into the forums, then <a
href="mailto:mdb@threerings.net">send me an email</a> and we'll try to get that
sorted out. Everyone in the Alpha Test should already have an <a
href="/register/">account</a> with Three Rings for Puzzle Pirates or Game
Gardens, and that account should work for Bang! Howdy too (the forums and the
game). If it ain't workin' or you don't have one, send me email at
<a href="mailto:mdb@threerings.net">mdb@threerings.net</a> and we'll sort you
out.

</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Missing Tutorials</span><br />
We've got a couple of tutorials in there that show you how the basic game
mechanics work, but we don't have tutorials for the two main gameplay modes
that are available, so I'll describe them here. They're purdy simple:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Claim Jumping</span> - each player has a claim that
contains gold nuggets. There are gold nuggets on the board. Move your units
onto the nuggets on the board, or next to an opponents' claim to steal one of
their nuggets. Then get that nugget carryin' unit back to your claim to deposit
the nugget into your claim to score points. The player with the most points
wins.

<li><span class="highlight">Cattle Rustlin'</span> - there are a bunch of
cattle scattered around the board. Move yer <em>Big Shot unit</em> to a square
next to the cattle to brand them. Keep yer opponent from stealing yer cattle
and the each cattle is worth 50 points when the round ends. The player with the
most points wins.
</ul>

We'll get some tutorials in shortly for those gameplay scenarios but in the
meanwhile we reckon you can figger things out from those descriptions and the
basic tutorials.
</p>

<p> Alrighty folks, that's all we got to say fer now. Head on into
<span class="highlight">The Saloon</span> and challenge us to a game!</p>
