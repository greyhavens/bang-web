                The <b>Buffalo Rider</b> attacks by ramming into her enemies.
                the further away she starts from her target, the more powerful 
                her attack.  Woe betide anyone caught between a charging Buffalo 
                Rider and a hard place.<br/><br/>
                She has good range and power, but cannot attack flying units.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Special Power:</b>If she starts at least four tiles away when 
                attacking, she will push her target backwards out of their current spot.

                The <b>Storm Caller</b> has a formidable ally in Mother Nature and 
                calls down a bolt of lightning to attack his enemies.  When he's 
                around, lightning can and does strike twice.<br/><br/>
                Watch where you're aimin' though, the chaining lighting doesn't 
                discriminate between friend and foe.<br/><br/>
                <b>Special Power: </b> His lightning attack chains
                at 80% to units standing next to his main target and at 50% to 
                units standing next to those.

                Beware the <b>Wendigo Attack</b>!  When darkness falls, your
                troops must stand in the <b>Petroglyph of Protection</b> to survive.  
                Only those 
                who hold the <b>Sacred Talisman</b> can roam free and unscathed when 
                the Deadly Wendigo appears.

                As one of the <b>Forest Guardians</b>, you must stand next the
                saplings into order to nuture their growth.  In order to save the
