</p>

<p><span class="highlight">When can I play it?</span><br/>
When it's ready pardner. We're roundin' up them dogies as fast as we can but
them cows ain't all come home yet. Check back here as we'll update this site
with new exciting information and sign up above and we'll email ya when we've
got really good news.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">How much will it cost?</span><br />
Bang! Howdy&trade; will be downloadable for free over the Internet and free to
play with no signup or recurring subscription fee. Players will pay for <em>Big
Shot</em> units and customizations and will buy train tickets to new towns
using our microcurrency system. Prices will be announced prior to official
launch and we expect that they will be downright inexpensive.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Will it work on my computer?</span><br/>
We will launch with support for Windows and Linux, and barring major problems,
MacOS X as well. A graphics accelerator will be required but not a fancy
one. Exact system requirements will be announced nearer to launch.</p>
