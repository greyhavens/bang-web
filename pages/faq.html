</p>

<p><span class="highlight">What sorta game is it?</span><br/>
We like to call it a <em>multiplayer online tactical strategy game</em>, but
all them fancy syllables don't say a whole lot to some folks, so we put
together <a href="about.html">an overview</a> of the game that does a better
job of explainin'.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">When can I play it?</span><br/>
Right now pardner! We're in open beta testing so just mosey on over to the
<a href="/download.html">download page</a> to get started.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">How much will it cost?</span><br />
Bang! Howdy&trade; is downloadable for free over the Internet and <span
class="highlight">free to play</span> with no signup or recurring subscription
fee. Players can buy <em>Big Shot</em> units, game items and train tickets to
new towns using our in-game microcurrency, but you don't gotta buy nothin' if
ya don't want. You decide if and when ta spend any of yer hard-earned cash.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Will it work on my computer?</span><br/>
We will launch with support for Windows, Linux, and MacOS X. A graphics
accelerator is required but not a real fancy one. Exact system requirements can
be seen on the <a href="/download.html">download page</a>.</p>
